ANAUNTER (uh-nan-ter) is a brand i'm developing, it's sort of a new idea and i'm trying to find where it will fit as a brand. I mad this website as aockup version of another website called "AZUKI". I fell in love with it the moment i saw it. The simplicity on on the outside showed how much more complex it is on the inside, especially if you're trying to hard code the entirety of it. This is still not complete, and the readability is still quite "shitty". I will commit to this very frequently, or when i get the code right. This will be great for my portfolio, any for any of you reading this that wants to make designs like these. I mean that's pretty much it for now, I will make sure of myself to make weekly commits (if I'm not bombarded with works from my academics) and hope to stay consistent with it.

WELCOME TO ANAUNTER...
THE JOURNEY STARTS NOW
